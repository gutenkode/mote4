# Mote Render Engine v4
The fourth version of my render engine, a wrapper for OpenGL functions using Java and LWJGL.
This project is a dependency for running other graphics programs I have made.

#### Overview
Mote wraps and automates common actions when setting up a rendering environment, including loading textures, shaders, meshes, and other resources.
A simple graphics program can be written using only one file and intuitive method calls, making Mote excellent for quickly creating an experiment or small project.
It can also, however, scale to support full games with multiple scenes and complex rendering pipelines.

#### Building
This repo is currently uploaded as an IntelliJ project.  It has LWJGL version 3 as a dependency.
